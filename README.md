# goas - a port of GNU Assembler written in go

`goas` is an assembler that behaves like `as`, GNU Assembler.

![goas-min-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/188741/134793225-411c06e7-982d-44aa-8fec-34139d5d080b.gif)

This is just a toy program to illustrate how an assembler works. Acutally I learned how an assembler works by writing this program :).

It does not mean to support all syntax or instructions, but  Linux x86-64 AT&T syntax only.
However, for any input it supports, it behaves exactly the same as `as`,
 which means it produces the very same binary files (*.o) as `as` does.

The most interesting thing is that it can assemble my Go compiler [babygo](https://github.com/DQNEO/babygo). (You can see it by running `make babygo`.)


# Requirements

You need a linux with gcc installed.
If you are using MacOS or Windows, you can use my docker image to run `goas`.

```cgo
docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/mnt/goas -w /mnt/goas dqneo/ubuntu-build-essential:go bash 
```

# How to build

```
$ go build
```

# How to use

Prepare a small assembly file `test.s`

```asm
.text
.global _start
_start:
  movq $42, %rdi # status
  movq $60, %rax # sys_exit
  syscall
```

And you can assemble it

```terminal
$ ./goas -o test.o test.s
$ ld -o test test.o
$ ./test; echo $?
42
```

# Supported Instructions

See test files under `/t` and `/t2` directory to know what syntax it can assemble.

# Test

```
$ make test
```
